- Problem Statement:

This project addresses the challenge of edge detection within images, a fundamental technique in image processing for locating object boundaries. Edge detection is crucial for tasks such as image segmentation, computer vision, and machine vision. The primary focus is on implementing two serial edge detection methods, primarily using the Prewitt operator, and subsequently parallelizing them using the OneAPI library (specifically TBB tasks).

- Expected Results:

The expected output is a black-and-white image where white pixels represent edges, and black areas represent the space between edges.

- Documentation:

The whole documentation with graphs and analysis is in the folder, and it's called "Paralelno programiranje".
